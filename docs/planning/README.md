## Current Focus

We're refocusing the SharedLens implementation based on the core requirements from the Shared Lens Migration Framework document.

## How to Add Documents

1. **Place your document in `docs/planning/`**
   - PDF, Markdown, Word docs all work
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Example: `Shared_Lens_Migration_Framework.pdf`

2. **Let Claude know**
   - Tell me you've added a document
   - I'll read and analyze it
   - We'll identify the core features together

3. **We'll create a focused plan**
   - Extract key requirements
   - Identify 2-3 core features
   - Build a simple, focused implementation

## Next Steps

1. Add your Shared Lens Migration Framework document to `docs/planning/`
2. Let me know when it's ready
3. We'll review it together and identify what to focus on
