Unit of measurement definition from an engineering perspective
Unit of Measurement - Engineering Definition
From an engineering perspective, a unit of measurement is a standardized quantity used as a reference for expressing and comparing physical dimensions, properties, or phenomena in a consistent and reproducible manner.
Key Characteristics
Standardization: Units must be precisely defined, internationally agreed upon, and traceable to fundamental constants or reproducible phenomena. This ensures measurements are consistent across different locations, instruments, and time periods.
Quantification: A unit provides the magnitude scale for a physical quantity. Any measurement consists of a numerical value multiplied by its unit (e.g., 5 meters, 220 volts, 3.5 kilograms).
Dimensional Consistency: Units must maintain dimensional homogeneity in equations and calculations. You cannot add meters to seconds, but you can add meters to kilometers (after conversion).
Engineering Context
In engineering practice, units serve several critical functions:
• Design specifications: Defining tolerances, capacities, and performance parameters
• Calculations: Ensuring mathematical operations produce physically meaningful results
• Communication: Providing unambiguous technical information between engineers, manufacturers, and clients
• Quality control: Establishing measurable criteria for acceptance testing and verification
• Safety: Setting limits and thresholds for safe operation
SI System
Modern engineering predominantly uses the International System of Units (SI), built on seven base units: meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (substance), and candela (luminous intensity). All other units are derived from these.
Engineers must also understand unit conversion, especially when working with legacy systems (imperial units) or specialized fields with customary units (like bar for pressure or horsepower for power).
From a procurement perspective
Unit of Measurement - Procurement Definition
From a procurement perspective, a unit of measurement is a standardized quantity specification that defines how goods or services are counted, priced, ordered, delivered, and invoiced in commercial transactions.
Key Characteristics
Commercial Standard: The unit must be clearly understood by both buyer and supplier to avoid disputes. It serves as the basis for pricing, quantity verification, and contract fulfillment.
Transaction Basis: Units determine how items are bought and sold - whether by piece, weight, volume, length, area, time, or other measures appropriate to the commodity or service.
Price Reference: The unit of measure directly impacts cost calculations. Price per unit (unit price) allows comparison between suppliers and products.
Common Procurement Applications
Physical Goods:
• Each (EA): Individual items (computers, chairs, machines)
• Dozen (DZ): Sets of 12
• Case/Carton (CS): Packaged quantities
• Kilogram/Pound (KG/LB): Weight-based commodities
• Liter/Gallon (L/GAL): Liquids and chemicals
• Meter/Foot (M/FT): Cable, piping, fabric
• Square meter (M²): Flooring, paneling, land
Services:
• Hour (HR): Labor, consulting, equipment rental
• Day/Month: Extended services or subscriptions
• Per project/Per job: Fixed-scope deliverables
Procurement Considerations
Order Quantity vs. Pricing Unit: Sometimes items are ordered in one unit but priced in another (e.g., ordering cable by the meter but priced per 100 meters).
Packaging vs. Consumable Unit: The shipping unit (pallets, boxes) may differ from the usable unit (individual pieces inside).
Unit Conversions: Procurement must manage conversions between supplier units and internal inventory units to ensure accurate ordering and receiving.
Standardization: Using consistent units across the organization improves purchasing efficiency, reduces errors, and facilitates spend analysis.
Contract Clarity: Purchase orders and contracts must explicitly state the unit of measure to prevent misunderstandings about quantities and pricing.
The procurement unit of measure is fundamentally about commercial agreement and transactional clarity rather than technical precision.
Because they are called the same, UOM does this cause confusion?
Yes - UOM Ambiguity Causes Significant Confusion
The fact that "Unit of Measurement" means different things in engineering versus procurement contexts creates substantial practical problems in organizations, especially in manufacturing, construction, and technical service industries.
Common Confusion Scenarios
Design vs. Purchase Mismatch
• Engineering specifies steel plate in millimeters thickness
• Procurement orders in "sheets" or "kilograms"
• Result: Wrong quantity delivered or pricing disputes
Precision vs. Commercial Packaging
• Engineer needs 47.5 meters of cable
• Supplier sells cable in 50-meter spools only
• Procurement must reconcile the technical requirement with commercial reality
Conversion Errors
• Engineering drawings show cubic meters
• Supplier quotes in truckloads or tons
• Someone must convert, and errors happen frequently
Inventory Management Issues
• Engineering BOM (Bill of Materials) lists "meters of pipe"
• Warehouse stocks "pieces of 6-meter lengths"
• ERP system struggles to track both simultaneously
Why This Happens
Different Objectives:
• Engineers care about technical accuracy and functional requirements
• Procurement cares about how suppliers sell and transactional efficiency
System Integration Challenges: ERP and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) systems must bridge engineering UOMs and procurement UOMs, often requiring complex conversion tables and dual unit tracking.
Industry Conventions: Different industries have established commercial trading practices that don't always align with technical measurement systems.
Real-World Impact
Organizations experience:
• Order errors: Wrong quantities purchased
• Cost overruns: Buying excess due to packaging constraints
• Project delays: Waiting for clarification on specifications
• Waste: Disposing of unusable excess material
• Communication breakdowns: Between technical and commercial teams
How Organizations Address This
Dual UOM Systems: Modern ERP systems maintain both "base UOM" (engineering) and "purchase UOM" (procurement) with defined conversion factors.
Cross-functional Teams: Including both engineers and procurement specialists in specification development.
Standardized Item Masters: Creating clear definitions that specify both technical and commercial units.
Clear Documentation: Purchase requisitions that show both "what we need technically" and "how we'll order commercially."
The confusion is real, costly, and a persistent challenge in technical industries. It requires deliberate organizational processes to manage effectively.
In the scenario you described about cable, the engineer creates a design part number for the exact length. What does procurement do about defining what to purchase from the supplier
Procurement's Cable Scenario Solution
In this scenario, procurement faces a classic make-or-buy unit reconciliation problem. Here's how they typically handle it:
The Challenge
• Engineering Part Number: "CABLE-47.5M" (design requirement for exact 47.5 meters)
• Supplier Reality: Sells cable in 50-meter spools, 100-meter reels, or continuous length from bulk rolls
• Procurement's Dilemma: How to fulfill the engineering requirement commercially
Procurement's Response Options
Option 1: Create a Purchased Part Number
Most common approach - Procurement creates a separate "purchased item" in the system:
• Engineering PN: CABLE-47.5M (what's needed in the design)
• Procurement PN: CABLE-TYPE-X-SPOOL-50M (what's actually bought from supplier)
• Conversion factor: 1 spool yields 1.05 design parts (with 2.5m waste/scrap)
The ERP system links these with a "where-used" relationship showing that the purchased spool supplies the design requirement.
Option 2: Buy by Running Length with Cut-to-Length Service
Some suppliers offer:
• Purchase cable "per meter" with minimum order quantities
• Supplier cuts to exact specified lengths
• Higher unit price but zero waste
• Procurement orders "47.5 M" directly
Option 3: Establish Bulk Material Purchasing
For high-volume production:
• Buy cable in bulk reels (500M, 1000M)
• Warehouse becomes a "manufacturing step" that cuts to length
• Engineering BOM shows 47.5M required
• Procurement manages bulk inventory
• Manufacturing/warehouse issues exact lengths to production
Option 4: Negotiate Custom Packaging
For repetitive, high-volume orders:
• Procurement negotiates with supplier for custom spool lengths
• Supplier winds cable in 48M or 50M spools specifically for this customer
• Reduces waste but requires volume commitment
ERP System Configuration
Modern systems handle this through:
Dual UOM Management:
• Base UOM: Meter (engineering unit)
• Purchase UOM: Each (spool)
• Conversion: 1 EA = 50 M
Item Master Attributes:
• Minimum order quantity: 1 spool
• Order multiple: 1 spool
• Yield factor: 95% (accounting for waste/scrap)
BOM Structure:
Assembly XYZ
  └─ CABLE-TYPE-X: 47.5 M required
       └─ Purchased from: SUPPLIER-SKU-50M-SPOOL
The Procurement Decision Process
1. Analyze usage patterns: Is this one-time or repetitive?
2. Calculate total cost: (Unit price + waste cost + handling) × volume
3. Evaluate supplier options: Who offers best commercial terms?
4. Determine inventory strategy: Stock spools or cut lengths?
5. Set up system logistics: How to track, issue, and reconcile?
Communication Back to Engineering
Procurement typically:
• Informs engineering of purchasing constraints (50M minimum)
• Requests design review if waste is significant: "Can you use 50M instead of 47.5M?"
• Establishes scrap allowances in the BOM (add 5% scrap factor)
• Negotiates tolerance: "Can we deliver 47.5M ±2.5M?"
Documentation
Purchase Order shows:
• Item: Cable Type X, 50M Spool
• Quantity: 1 EA
• Unit Price: $250/spool ($5/meter effective)
• Reference: For Engineering PN CABLE-47.5M, Project ABC
The key insight: Procurement creates a translation layer between engineering's technical specification and the supplier's commercial offering, managing the gap through system configuration, process, and sometimes negotiation.
How do I represent this for the shared lens application

## Key Relationships to Model
### 1. **Conversion/Translation Layer**
```
Engineering → Procurement Translation
Input: 47.5 M required
Rules:
  - Supplier sells in 50M spools only
  - Cannot split spools
  - Round up to next whole spool
Output: Order 1 EA (50M spool)
Consequence: 2.5M waste/scrap
```

### 2. **Conflict/Tension Points** (Critical for Shared Lens!)
```
Tension: Precision vs. Packaging
├─ Engineering needs: Exactly 47.5M
├─ Procurement constraint: Only available in 50M
├─ Impact: 5% material waste
├─ Cost: $12.50 excess per assembly
└─ Resolution Options:
    ├─ Accept waste and allocate cost
    ├─ Redesign to use 50M
    ├─ Find alternate supplier with cut-to-length
    └─ Stock 50M spools and manage remnants
```

### 3. **Context Switching**
Show how the **same inquiry** gets different answers:
**Question: "How much cable do we have?"**
- Engineering: "Enough for 2.1 assemblies" (100M ÷ 47.5M)
- Procurement: "2 spools"
- Warehouse: "100 meters in inventory"
- Finance: "$500 of cable inventory"

Key Insight for Shared Lens
The power of your application should be showing that this isn't a communication problem between departments - it's an inherent complexity where the same physical reality must be described differently based on the context of use. The UOM "confusion" isn't a bug - it's a feature of how different professional domains interact with shared resources.
Your app should make these translations visible and manageable rather than trying to force a single "correct" view.
I guess a worse case scenario would be if the engineer needed 52.5M for each design
The 52.5M Nightmare Scenario
You've identified a critical edge case that exposes the full complexity of UOM conflicts. This is where the system breaks down and forces difficult decisions.
The Problem
Engineering Requirement: 52.5 M per assembly Supplier Reality: Sells in 50M spools only
Mathematical Crisis:
• Need: 52.5 M
• Buy 1 spool: 50 M (SHORT by 2.5M - doesn't work)
• Buy 2 spools: 100 M (excess 47.5M - 95% waste)
This creates a forced choice scenario with no good options.
Real-World Response Paths
Path 1: Engineering Design Change (Most Common)
Procurement escalates back to Engineering:
"We have a problem. Your design needs 52.5M, but cable only comes in 50M spools. Options:
• Redesign to use ≤50M, OR
• Accept 100M purchase cost (doubles material cost)"
Engineering must decide:
• Can we shorten the cable run? (routing optimization)
• Can we use a junction/splice at 50M? (adds complexity, cost)
• Is there technical flexibility in the 52.5M requirement?
• What's the tolerance? Could 50M actually work?
Likely outcome: Engineering redesigns to 49.5M, staying within one spool.
Path 2: Find Alternative Supplier
Procurement searches for:
• Suppliers offering cut-to-length service
• Bulk cable suppliers (buy 100M+ rolls, cut in-house)
• Different packaging options (some offer 25M, 75M, 100M reels)
• Custom order arrangements for volume customers
Trade-offs: Usually higher unit cost, longer lead times, minimum order quantities.
Path 3: Accept Massive Waste (Rare)
For low-volume, high-value assemblies:
• Buy 2 spools (100M) per assembly
• Use 52.5M, waste 47.5M
• Cost the waste into the product
When this happens:
• Aerospace/defense with cost-plus contracts
• Prototype/R&D phases
• Emergency/rush orders
• No viable alternatives exist
Path 4: Create Assembly Process Workaround
Engineering solution that splits the requirement:
• Use 50M cable as primary run
• Use separate 2.5M jumper cable (different part)
• Add splice/connector to BOM
• Increases assembly complexity and labor
New BOM:
Assembly XYZ
├─ Cable Type X (main run): 50 M
├─ Cable Type X (jumper): 2.5 M (from remnants or small spool)
└─ Splice connector: 1 EA
```

### Path 5: Inventory Management Solution
**Warehouse becomes a fabrication step:**
- Buy cable in bulk rolls (500M)
- Cut to length in-house (52.5M pieces)
- Track as "make" item not "buy" item
**Requires:**
- Cable cutting equipment
- Quality control for length verification
- Labor for cutting/preparation
- Storage for bulk rolls and cut pieces
## How This Escalates in Organizations
### Stage 1: Discovery (Procurement)
```
Procurement: "I can't order 52.5M. Supplier only has 50M spools."
```
### Stage 2: Impact Analysis
```
Cost Impact:
- Option A (2 spools): $500 for 100M = $9.52/M effective (95% waste)
- Option B (cut-to-length): $8.50/M = $446.25 (66% premium per meter)
- Option C (redesign to 50M): $250 for 50M = $5/M (design cost + delay)
Lead Time Impact:
- Spools: 2 weeks
- Cut-to-length: 6 weeks
- Redesign cycle: 2-4 weeks
Production Impact:
- Current: 10 assemblies/week needed
- Waste scenario: $5,000/week excess material cost
- Annual waste: $260,000
```
### Stage 3: Cross-Functional Meeting
**Attendees**: Engineering, Procurement, Manufacturing, Finance, Project Management
**Discussion Points:**
- Can design be modified? (Engineering)
- What's the cost impact? (Finance)
- Can we delay? (Project Management)
- Can we absorb the waste? (Finance/Manufacturing)
- What about suppliers B, C, D? (Procurement)
### Stage 4: Decision & Documentation
**Final Decision** (example):
"Engineering will redesign cable routing to 49.8M, maintaining 0.2M safety margin. Procurement will order 50M spools. Estimated redesign time: 1 week. Delays production start by 1 week but saves $260K annually."
**Engineering Change Order (ECO)** issued:
- Old design: 52.5M cable
- New design: 49.8M cable
- Reason: Supplier packaging constraints, cost optimization
- Impact: All drawings, BOMs, test procedures updated

💬 Discussion Thread: Cable Length Conflict

[Procurement - M.Chen] @Engineering
"Can't source 52.5M. Supplier max is 50M spools. 
Need guidance."
[Engineering - J.Smith]
"This is the measured distance. Can we review 
alternative routing?"
[Manufacturing - K.Williams]
"We could use a connector at 50M if that helps?"
[Engineering - J.Smith]
"Connector adds failure point. Let me check if we 
can reroute through the lower channel instead."
[Engineering - J.Smith] 2 hours later
"Good news - lower channel routing = 49.8M. 
Preparing ECO now."
[Project Mgmt - R.Patel]
"Will this delay cause schedule impact?"
[Engineering - J.Smith]
"1 week for drawing updates. But saves $260K/year 
in material waste. Worth it."
[Finance - A.Kumar]
"Approved from finance. ROI in <1 month of production."

Key Insight for Shared Lens
This scenario demonstrates that sometimes there is no translation - there's an actual incompatibility between perspectives that requires systemic change, not just better communication or data mapping.
Your application should:
1. Detect impossible conflicts (mathematical impossibilities, not just mismatches)
2. Escalate appropriately (flag as decision-required, not just information)
3. Present options with consequences (decision support, not just data)
4. Track resolution history (organizational learning)
5. Show the human collaboration (this is where engineering meets business reality)
The 52.5M scenario is where Shared Lens proves its value - not by solving the problem, but by making the problem visible to all stakeholders simultaneously with clarity about why it can't be solved through normal channels.
This is the difference between a data integration tool and a collaborative sense-making platform.

### 6. **UOM Definition Standards**
Engineering typically follows ISO or ANSI standards for UOM:
```
STANDARD UNIT CODES (Engineering)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

LENGTH:
  M  = Meter (SI base unit)
  MM = Millimeter (10^-3 m)
  CM = Centimeter (10^-2 m)
  KM = Kilometer (10^3 m)
  
  IN = Inch (25.4 mm) - where imperial required
  FT = Foot (0.3048 m)
AREA:
  M2 = Square meter
  MM2 = Square millimeter
VOLUME:
  M3 = Cubic meter
  L  = Liter
MASS:
  KG = Kilogram
  G  = Gram
  MG = Milligram
COUNT:
  EA = Each (discrete items)
  PC = Piece (alternative to EA)
  SET = Set (grouped items)
USAGE RULES:
1. Use SI units as primary standard
2. Allow imperial as secondary (in parentheses)
3. Never mix units within same dimension
4. Always specify UOM explicitly in BOM
5. Define conversion factors in item master
```
## Engineering UOM Definition Best Practices
### Part Number Encoding
Engineers often encode key parameters in part numbers:
**Systematic Approach:**
```
CABLE-TYPE-LENGTH-GAUGE
  │     │     │      │
  │     │     │      └─ Wire gauge (18)
  │     │     └──────── Length in meters (47.5M)
  │     └────────────── Cable type identifier (X)
  └──────────────────── Category (CABLE)

Example: CABLE-X-47.5M-18AWG
Alternatively:
CABLE-47.5M (if type/gauge in description)
```
**Advantages:**
- Length immediately visible
- Easy to search/filter
- Prevents duplicate definitions
- Self-documenting
**Disadvantages:**
- Creates proliferation of part numbers
- Every length needs unique PN
- Harder to manage changes
### Tolerance Documentation
Engineers must specify **how precise** the length needs to be:
```
DIMENSION FORMATS:
Tight tolerance (precision critical):
  47.50 ± 0.05 M    (50mm tolerance)
  
Standard tolerance (typical):
  47.5 ± 0.1 M      (100mm tolerance)
  
Loose tolerance (non-critical):
  47.5 ± 0.5 M      (500mm tolerance)
  
Reference dimension (information only):
  (47.5) M          (not for manufacturing)
  
Maximum/minimum limits:
  47.5 MAX M        (cannot exceed)
  47.5 MIN M        (cannot be less)
```
### Measurement Reference Points
Critical for cables - **where do you measure from?**
```
CABLE LENGTH DEFINITION METHODS:
Method 1: End-to-End (Physical)
  ├──────────────────────────┤
  │                          │
 [A]    Cable body          [B]

  Excludes: connectors, terminals

Method 2: Installed Length (Functional)

  │        Route path           │
  │    ╭───────────────╮        │

  └────┴───────────────┴────────┘
  
  Length = Centerline path in installed position
  Includes: bends, routing, sag

  Includes: extra for crimping, stripping

SPECIFICATION MUST CLARIFY WHICH METHOD!
```
## Common Engineering Mistakes with UOM
### Mistake 1: Ambiguous UOM
```
❌ BAD:
ITEM: Cable
QTY: 47.5
UOM: (blank)

✓ GOOD:
ITEM: Cable Type X
QTY: 47.5
UOM: M (Meter)
```

### Mistake 2: Mixing Units
```
❌ BAD:
Cable: 47.5 M
Wire: 18 inches
Tubing: 2 feet

✓ GOOD:
Cable: 47.5 M
Wire: 0.457 M (18 inches)
Tubing: 0.610 M (2 feet)
```

### Mistake 3: Insufficient Precision
```
❌ BAD:
QTY: 48 M  (rounded from 47.5)

✓ GOOD:
QTY: 47.5 M  (actual requirement)
```

### Mistake 4: No Tolerance
```
❌ BAD:
Length: 47.5 M

✓ GOOD:
Length: 47.5 ± 0.1 M
```

### Mistake 5: Wrong Part Number for Length
```
❌ BAD:
PN: CABLE-TYPE-X  (generic cable)
QTY: 47.5 M       (length in BOM only)

✓ GOOD:
PN: CABLE-TYPE-X-47.5M  (length in PN)
OR
PN: CABLE-ASSY-001  (unique assembly PN)
with reference to drawing showing 47.5M
```

## Engineering Change Control for UOM
If the length changes (like 52.5M → 49.8M scenario):
```
ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDER: ECO-2847
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

CHANGE TYPE: Design Modification
REASON: Supplier packaging constraint - cost optimization
AFFECTED ITEMS:
  CABLE-47.5M → CABLE-49.8M (new PN created)
  
OLD SPECIFICATION:
  Part Number: CABLE-47.5M
  Length: 47.5 ± 0.1 M
  Drawing: EE-12345-001 Rev A

NEW SPECIFICATION:
  Part Number: CABLE-49.8M
  Length: 49.8 ± 0.1 M
  Drawing: EE-12345-001 Rev B
IMPACT ANALYSIS:
  ✓ Electrical: No impact (within spec)
  ✓ Mechanical: Fits alternate routing
  ✓ Testing: No change required
  ✓ Documentation: Update assembly manual
  ⚠ Procurement: New supplier part mapping
  ✓ Inventory: Use existing stock first, then new

IMPLEMENTATION:
  Effective Date: Upon approval
  Disposition: Use existing stock (47.5M) until depleted
  New Production: Use 49.8M design

  Engineering: J.Smith ✓
  Manufacturing: K.Williams ✓
  Quality: T.Anderson ✓
  Procurement: M.Chen ✓
Summary: How Engineering Defines UOM
Engineers define UOM through multiple interrelated documents that form a complete specification:
1. Drawing: Visual representation with dimensioned length
2. BOM: Structured data with part number, quantity, UOM
3. Part Master: Detailed attributes and specifications
4. Specification: Standards, tolerances, measurement methods
5. Change Control: History of decisions and modifications
The UOM is never ambiguous in engineering documentation - it's explicitly stated, standardized, and traceable. The challenge arises when this engineering definition must interface with procurement's commercial reality.
Not a fan of part number encoding. What about a unique part number and define the remainder in attributes. Some ERP systems have limitations on part number and name character length. Provide suggestions
Non-Encoded Part Number Approach with Attributes
You're absolutely right - part number encoding creates serious problems. Modern best practice favors semantic-free part numbers with rich attribute data.
Problems with Encoded Part Numbers
System Limitations:
• ERP character limits (often 18-25 characters max)
• Special characters forbidden or cause import issues
• Case sensitivity problems
• Search/sort difficulties
Business Problems:
• Design changes require new part numbers (ECO nightmare)
• Proliferation of near-identical parts
• Difficult to standardize across product lines
• Confusing for humans to parse
• Database indexing inefficiencies
Example of Encoded Chaos:
CABLE-X-47.5M-18AWG-BLK-PVC-600V-CRIMP-A
                ↑
          Hits 40+ character limit in many systems
```

## Searchability Strategy
With semantic-free part numbers, you need **strong search capabilities**:
### Multi-Field Search
```
SEARCH EXAMPLE: "Cable 47.5 meter"
Search fields:
├─ Part Number: CAB-012847-00 ❌ (no match)
├─ Description: "Cable Assembly..." ✓ (matches "cable")
├─ Attribute Length: 47.5 ✓ (exact match)
├─ Attribute Length_UOM: M ✓ (matches "meter")
└─ Drawing Number: EE-12345-001 ❌ (no match)

RESULT: CAB-012847-00 (high relevance)
```

### Intelligent Part Name Construction
Since part number is meaningless, **description becomes critical**:
```
PART NAME FORMULA (Auto-generated from attributes):
[Category] [Type] [Key_Param1] [Key_Param2] [Key_Param3]
Example:
Category: Cable Assembly
Type: Power
Length: 47.5M
Gauge: 18AWG
Voltage: 600V
GENERATED NAME:
"Cable Assy Power 47.5M 18AWG 600V"
Alternative format:
"Cable Assy, 47.5M, 18AWG, Type X, 600V"
Benefits:
- Human readable
- Contains searchable keywords
- Auto-updates if attributes change
- Consistent across all parts
```
## Managing Design Changes with Attributes
### Scenario: Length changes 47.5M → 49.8M

**Option 1: Create New Part Number (Recommended)**
```
OLD PART:
  PN: CAB-012847-00
  Status: Obsolete (superseded)
  Length: 47.5 M
  Superseded By: CAB-015921-00
  
NEW PART:
  PN: CAB-015921-00
  Status: Active
  Length: 49.8 M
  Supersedes: CAB-012847-00
  
REASON: Different functional length = different part
```
**Option 2: Revision Change (If length within tolerance)**
```
PART: CAB-012847-00
Rev A → Rev B

CHANGE:
  Attribute: Length_Tolerance
  Old: ± 0.1 M
  New: ± 0.5 M
  
REASON: Tolerance relaxation, same nominal length
```
## Attribute Naming Conventions
**Standardized attribute names** are critical:
```
NAMING STANDARD
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Format: [Domain]_[Parameter]_[Qualifier]
Examples:
  DIM_Length_Nominal
  DIM_Length_Tolerance
  DIM_Length_Min
  DIM_Length_Max
  DIM_Diameter_Outer
  DIM_Width
  
  ELEC_Voltage_Rating
  ELEC_Current_Rating
  ELEC_Resistance
  
  MAT_Conductor_Type
  MAT_Insulation_Material
  
  MFG_Make_Buy
  MFG_Lead_Time
  
  UOM_Base
  UOM_Secondary
  UOM_Precision
Benefits:
- Alphabetically groups related attributes
- Clear domain ownership
- Supports reporting/analytics
- Consistent across system
```
## Workarounds for System Limitations
### If Custom Fields are Limited (< 10 fields)
**Priority Attributes:**
```
1. UDF_Length [decimal]        ← Most critical
2. UDF_Length_UOM [text]       ← Unit
3. UDF_Wire_Gauge [text]       ← Key spec
4. UDF_Cable_Type [text]       ← Identifier
5. UDF_Drawing_Num [text]      ← Reference
6. UDF_Status [list]           ← Lifecycle
7. UDF_Make_Buy [list]         ← Planning
8. UDF_Voltage [integer]       ← Safety critical
```

**Use structured description field for remaining data**
### If No Custom Fields Available
**Embed in description with parsing tags:**
```
DESCRIPTION:
Cable Assy, Power Distribution
[LEN:47.5M±0.1][GAUGE:18AWG][TYPE:X][VOLT:600V]
[DWG:EE-12345-001][SPEC:EE-SPEC-CABLE-001]
Stranded copper conductor, black PVC insulation
Crimp terminals both ends (TERM-A)
```
Can be parsed programmatically: `[TAG:VALUE]`
## Integration with Procurement
**Engineering attributes** must map to **procurement needs**:
```
ITEM: CAB-012847-00 (Engineering Part)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

ENGINEERING VIEW:
  Length Required: 47.5 M
  Base UOM: M
  Type: Make (fabricated)
  
PROCUREMENT VIEW (linked):
  Source Material: CAB-RAW-001 (bulk cable)
  Purchase UOM: EA (spool)
  Purchase Qty: 1 spool
  Spool Length: 50 M
  Utilization: 95%
  Waste: 2.5 M per assembly
  
LINKED ITEM: CAB-RAW-001
  Description: Cable Type X, bulk stock
  Purchase UOM: EA (spool)
  Purchase Size: 50 M per spool
  Supplier PN: ACME-CABLE-X-50M
  Unit Price: $250/spool
  Effective Cost: $5/M
This creates the translation layer between engineering specs and procurement reality, while keeping part numbers clean and attributes structured.
Summary: Best Practices
✅ DO:
• Use short, semantic-free part numbers
• Put ALL meaning in structured attributes
• Standardize attribute naming
• Auto-generate readable descriptions
• Enable parametric search
• Link engineering to procurement items
• Version control through ECO/revision
❌ DON'T:
• Encode dimensions in part number
• Exceed system character limits
• Use special characters that cause issues
• Rely on humans to parse encoded meanings
• Change part numbers for attribute changes (unless functionally different)
• Mix units in descriptions without clear labels
The key: Part numbers are database keys, attributes are data.
So how do we tag something like a cable that has a specific length for procurement to review it it's lens when the purchase length potentially is different. My not all buy items would have the issue. Like fasten have length but are purchased as an "each" item.
Tagging Items with Engineering vs. Procurement UOM Conflicts
This is a critical distinction - you need to flag items where the engineering UOM and procurement UOM are dimensionally incompatible, not just different.
The Key Distinction
No Conflict (Simple Conversion)
FASTENER EXAMPLE:
Engineering needs: 10 EA (10 bolts)
Procurement buys: 1 BX (box of 100 bolts)
Conversion: 1 BX = 100 EA
✓ Same dimension (count)
✓ Simple multiplication
✓ No waste issue
✓ No procurement review needed
```

### Has Conflict (Dimensional Mismatch)
```
CABLE EXAMPLE:
Engineering needs: 47.5 M (continuous length)
Procurement buys: 1 EA (spool containing 50M)
Conversion: 1 EA = 50 M, but...
⚠️ Different dimensions (count vs. length)
⚠️ Packaging constraint
⚠️ Potential waste
⚠️ REQUIRES procurement review
```

## Attribute Tags for Conflict Detection
### Primary Attribute: UOM_Conflict_Type
```
ITEM ATTRIBUTE: UOM_Conflict_Type
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

VALUES:
├─ "NONE" (default)
│   Engineering and procurement use compatible UOMs
│   Examples: Fasteners (EA to BX), resistors (EA to RL)
│
├─ "PACKAGING"
│   Different UOMs but straightforward conversion
│   Examples: Screws (EA to 100-packs), wire (M to spools)
│   Action: Auto-conversion, round up to package size
│
├─ "DIMENSIONAL"  ← KEY FLAG FOR YOUR USE CASE
│   Engineering specifies continuous dimension,
│   Procurement must buy discrete packages
│   Examples: Cable (length), sheet metal (area), pipe (length)
│   Action: REQUIRES procurement review and planning
│
├─ "CUT_TO_LENGTH"
│   Supplier offers cutting service at premium
│   Examples: Cable, tubing, extrusions
│   Action: Evaluate cut-to-length vs. standard packaging
│
└─ "BULK_MANAGED"
    Buy in bulk, cut/dispense internally
    Examples: Solder wire, adhesive tape, chain
    Action: Inventory management handles dispensing
```

### Supporting Attributes
```
DIMENSIONAL CONFLICT ATTRIBUTES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

UOM_Conflict_Type: DIMENSIONAL
Engineering_UOM: M (meter - continuous)
Engineering_Quantity: 47.5
Engineering_Tolerance: ± 0.1
Engineering_Dimension_Type: Length
Procurement_UOM: EA (each - discrete)
Procurement_Package_Size: 50 M per spool
Procurement_Package_Type: Spool
Procurement_Minimum_Order: 1 EA

Waste_Cost_Impact: $12.50
Requires_Review: TRUE
Review_Reason: "Engineering length exceeds standard package"
Procurement_Action_Required: "Evaluate suppliers, cut-to-length, or redesign"
```
## Detection Logic / Business Rules
### Rule 1: Dimensional Type Mismatch
```
IF Engineering_Dimension_Type = "CONTINUOUS"
   (Length, Area, Volume, Mass, Time)
AND Procurement_UOM = "EA" or "PC" or "BX" or "SET"
   (Discrete count units)
THEN
   UOM_Conflict_Type = "DIMENSIONAL"
   Requires_Review = TRUE
```
### Rule 2: Requirement Exceeds Package Size
```
IF Engineering_Quantity > Procurement_Package_Size
THEN
   UOM_Conflict_Type = "DIMENSIONAL"
   Multi_Package_Required = TRUE
   Requires_Review = TRUE
   Alert_Engineering = TRUE
   Alert_Message = "Length requirement exceeds standard package size"
```
### Rule 3: High Waste Threshold
```
IF Waste_per_Unit > [Threshold, e.g., 10% or $50]
THEN
   Requires_Review = TRUE
   Alert_Finance = TRUE
   Review_Reason = "Material waste exceeds acceptable threshold"
```

Summary: The Tag Strategy
Core Concept: Not all UOM differences need review - only dimensional mismatches where:
1. Engineering specifies continuous dimension (length, area, volume)
2. Procurement must buy discrete packages
3. Package size creates waste or multi-package needs
4. The mismatch has significant cost/operational impact
Key Attributes to Implement:
• UOM_Conflict_Type (enum: NONE, PACKAGING, DIMENSIONAL, CUT_TO_LENGTH, BULK_MANAGED)
• Requires_Review (boolean)
• Review_Status (enum: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, RE_EVALUATE)
• Waste_per_Unit (decimal)
• Waste_Cost_Impact (currency)
Workflow:
1. System auto-detects conflicts on item creation
2. Flags items requiring procurement review
3. Blocks release until reviewed
4. Documents decision and alternatives
5. Tracks ongoing impact
This makes the invisible visible - surfacing the procurement challenges that engineering specs create, enabling proactive collaboration rather than reactive firefighting.

Shared Lens Application - Design Requirements
UOM Conflict Management Feature

1. FEATURE OVERVIEW
1.1 Purpose
Enable cross-functional visibility and management of Unit of Measure conflicts between engineering specifications and procurement constraints, particularly where dimensional mismatches create operational and cost impacts.
1.2 User Personas
• Engineering: Defines technical requirements without full visibility to procurement constraints
• Procurement: Sources materials within supplier packaging constraints
• Manufacturing: Manages material utilization and waste
• Finance: Analyzes cost impacts of material waste
• Product Management: Makes trade-off decisions on design vs. cost
1.3 Core Value Proposition
Transform UOM conflicts from hidden friction into visible, manageable trade-offs through multi-perspective item representation and collaborative decision workflows.

## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 3.1 Conflict Detection Engine
#### FR-3.1.1: Automatic Conflict Detection
**Trigger**: Item save/update with Make_Buy = "MAKE" or "BUY"
**Logic**:
```
IF dimension_type IN [LENGTH_CONTINUOUS, AREA_CONTINUOUS, 
                      VOLUME_CONTINUOUS, MASS_CONTINUOUS]
AND procurement_uom IN [EA, PC, BX, SET] (discrete)
THEN
  conflict_type = DIMENSIONAL
  requires_review = TRUE
  conflict_severity = calculate_severity()
  
IF engineering_quantity > procurement_package_size
THEN
  conflict_type = EXCEEDS_PACKAGE
  conflict_severity = HIGH or CRITICAL
  packages_required = CEILING(eng_qty / pkg_size)
  requires_engineering_review = TRUE
```
#### FR-3.1.2: Severity Calculation
```
Calculate conflict_severity:
IF conflict_type = NONE
  RETURN None
IF conflict_type = EXCEEDS_PACKAGE
  RETURN Critical
IF waste_cost_per_unit > $100 OR utilization_rate < 50%
  RETURN High
ELSE IF waste_cost_per_unit > $50 OR utilization_rate < 70%
  RETURN Medium
ELSE IF waste_cost_per_unit > $10 OR utilization_rate < 90%
  RETURN Low
ELSE
  RETURN None
```
#### FR-3.1.3: Impact Calculations
```
Calculate waste_quantity:
  waste_quantity = procurement_package_size - engineering_quantity
  
Calculate utilization_rate:
  utilization_rate = (engineering_quantity / procurement_package_size) * 100
  
Calculate waste_cost_per_unit:
  waste_cost_per_unit = (waste_quantity / procurement_package_size) * unit_price
  
Calculate annual_waste_cost (if volume known):
  annual_waste_cost = waste_cost_per_unit * annual_volume
```
#### FR-3.1.4: Multi-Package Detection
```
IF engineering_quantity > procurement_package_size
THEN
  packages_required = CEILING(engineering_quantity / procurement_package_size)
  total_package_quantity = packages_required * procurement_package_size
  excess_quantity = total_package_quantity - engineering_quantity
  actual_cost = packages_required * unit_price
  cost_variance = actual_cost - standard_cost
```
### 3.2 Review Workflow
#### FR-3.2.1: Review Task Creation
**Trigger**: Conflict detected with requires_review = TRUE
**Actions**:
1. Create ConflictReview record with status = PENDING
2. Assign to default procurement reviewer (configurable)
3. Set due_date based on item priority (configurable)
4. Send notification to assigned reviewer
5. Block item status change to "Released" until review complete
#### FR-3.2.2: Review Assignment Rules
```
Assign reviewer based on:
  - conflict_type
  - conflict_severity
  - item category
  - dollar threshold
  - department
Example rules:
  IF conflict_severity = CRITICAL
    ASSIGN TO senior_buyer AND engineering_manager
  ELSE IF annual_waste_cost > $10,000
    ASSIGN TO procurement_manager
  ELSE
    ASSIGN TO category_buyer
```
#### FR-3.2.3: Review Workflow States
```
State transitions:
PENDING → IN_PROGRESS (reviewer starts work)
IN_PROGRESS → APPROVED (conflict accepted)
IN_PROGRESS → APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS (conditions documented)
IN_PROGRESS → ENGINEERING_CHANGE_REQUIRED (escalate to engineering)
IN_PROGRESS → REJECTED (cannot proceed)

APPROVED → RE_EVALUATE (trigger condition met)
```

#### FR-3.2.4: Approval Requirements
```
Approval matrix (configurable):
IF conflict_severity = LOW
  REQUIRES: Category buyer approval
  
IF conflict_severity = MEDIUM
  REQUIRES: Category buyer + Engineering approval
  
IF conflict_severity = HIGH
  REQUIRES: Category buyer + Engineering + Finance approval
  
IF conflict_severity = CRITICAL
  REQUIRES: Procurement manager + Engineering manager + Finance approval
```
#### FR-3.2.5: Notification Rules
```
Send notifications:
ON conflict detected:
  NOTIFY assigned reviewer
  
ON review assigned:
  NOTIFY assignee
  
ON due date approaching (3 days):
  NOTIFY assignee + manager
  
ON review status change:
  NOTIFY item creator + assignee
  
ON approval required:
  NOTIFY approvers
  
ON engineering change required:
  NOTIFY engineering owner + project manager
```
