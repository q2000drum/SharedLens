### 3. We'll Review Together

I'll:
- Read and analyze the document
- Identify the core requirements
- Ask clarifying questions about priorities
- Help you focus on 2-3 key features
- Create a simple, focused implementation plan

## What to Expect

### The Refocus Process

1. **Document Review** (15-30 min discussion)
   - Read the framework
   - Understand sponsor's vision
   - Identify what matters most to the customer

2. **Feature Prioritization** (Discussion)
   - What's the #1 problem to solve?
   - What's the #2 feature?
   - What can wait for v2?

3. **Simple Plan** (1 page)
   - Clear scope
   - Focused features
   - Realistic timeline

4. **Focused Build** (Days, not weeks)
   - Core functionality only
   - Clean, maintainable code
   - Easy to demonstrate

## Philosophy for Next Iteration

**Keep It Simple:**
- Solve ONE core problem really well
- Not 10 problems halfway

**Focus on Value:**
- What does the customer need most?
- What demonstrates the vision best?
- What's achievable in the time available?

**Build for Demo:**
- Clear value proposition
- Easy to understand
- Works reliably
